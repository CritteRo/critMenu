# critMenu - A scaleform-based FiveM menu framework.

## About
critMenu is a very lightweight (0.04ms when used) menu framework for FiveM, made using the orbital cannon menu scaleform.

## Features
* Event-based menu creation and modification
* Selecting a button will trigger a configurable client-side event with the menuID and buttonID parameters, that you can use in your scripts.
* Clean look (for me, at least).
